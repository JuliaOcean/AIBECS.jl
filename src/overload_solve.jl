The `linsolve` field is forwarded to `LinearSolve.LinearProblem`, so any

search and lazy Jacobian refresh, after Kelley 2003).

Solves `prob` using an AIBECS-customized Newton–Chord–Shamanskii method with
Armijo line search. Convergence is delegated to NonlinearSolveBase termination
modes — the default mirrors `NonlinearSolve`'s `:regular` algorithm default
(`AbsNormSafeBestTerminationMode` on the ∞-norm of the residual). Pass
`abstol`/`reltol` to tighten or loosen, or pass any
`AbstractNonlinearTerminationMode` (e.g. `NormTerminationMode(norm)`,
`RelNormTerminationMode(norm)`) to swap criteria.

# Warm-starting via `linear_cache`

`linear_cache` (advanced) accepts a `LinearSolve.LinearCache` from a previous
solve. When supplied it replaces the internal `init(LinearProblem(…))` call,
so the caller's factorisation is reused on the first Newton iteration. This
matters in two settings:

1. Outer optimisers (e.g. `F1Method`, `Optimization.jl`) that already hold a
   factorised Jacobian for the current parameter point — feeding it back in
   skips the most expensive operation of the inner Newton solve.
2. Parameter sweeps where adjacent grid cells share most of the Jacobian's
   numerical content — the previous cell's factor is a useful warm-start.

The caller is responsible for setting `linear_cache.A`,
`linear_cache.cacheval`, and `linear_cache.isfresh` to a coherent triple
before the call. The cache's RHS must be a vector (length `nb`). Shamanskii's
ratio check + Armijo's line-search are the safety net if the supplied
factors turn out to be too stale — a bad warm-start slows convergence by at
most one Newton iteration before the factorisation is refreshed.

    solve(prob::SteadyStateProblem{...,Dual,...}, alg::CTKAlg; ...)

When `prob.p` carries `ForwardDiff.Dual` numbers (i.e. AIBECS's `solve` is
invoked *inside* `ForwardDiff.gradient` / `ForwardDiff.hessian`), strip the
duals, run the primal solve via the existing CTKAlg method, and reconstruct
the dual `u*` via the implicit function theorem:

    ∂u*/∂p  =  -(∂f/∂u)⁻¹ ∂f/∂p     (at u*, p)

Reuses `prob.f.jac` for `∂f/∂u` (analytical/sparse from `AIBECSFunction`).
For nested duals (Hessian path), this dispatch fires recursively — one Dual
layer is peeled per recursion level, with the innermost solve hitting the
Float64 path.

!!! note "Production-scale Hessians"
    `ForwardDiff.hessian` over this dispatch costs `O(N_partials)` Newton
    solves and uses LinearSolve's `DualLinearCache` splitting (sparse all the
    way down). It is fine for small/medium circulations but not competitive
    with `F1Method`'s analytical gradient/Hessian formula, which reuses a
    cached steady state. Prefer `F1Method` for production-scale Hessians.

!!! warning "Partial-derivative accuracy"
    The primal Newton iteration terminates when `‖F(u)‖` meets `abstol`/`reltol`
    — only the *primal* `u*` is guaranteed to that tolerance. The IFT-reconstructed
    `∂u*/∂p` is evaluated at the not-quite-converged `u_steady` and inherits the
    primal residual: a sloppy primal produces sloppy partials, and the solver
    will not run extra iterations on the partials' behalf. To get derivatives to
    near-machine precision you must force the solver past its own stopping rule,
    e.g. `abstol = 0, reltol = 0` and let it grind out to `maxItNewton`. AIBECS's
    `test/ad_through_solve.jl` and the cross-check in F1Method's
    `bp-claude/ift-cross-check` branch show this pattern on toy problems.
    **This is not a practical strategy at production grid sizes** — each forced
    iteration costs a sparse factorisation. Use `F1Method`'s analytical
    gradient/Hessian for production-scale derivatives.

!!! warning "NonlinearSolveBase coupling"
    This dispatch depends on `NonlinearSolveBase.nodual_value`,
    `nonlinearsolve_∂f_∂p`, and `nonlinearsolve_dual_solution`. They are
    declared public via `@compat(public, …)` in NonlinearSolveBase but live
    in an internal-feeling part of the SciML stack. If they move or change
    signature, this dispatch breaks; a runtime `@warn` (below, gated to
    one-shot via `maxlog=1`) surfaces the dependency in user logs.

Wrap an AIBECS [`AIBECSFunction`](@ref) into a `SciMLBase.ODEProblem` with the
sparse Jacobian buffer type attached as `jac_prototype`. Without this, stiff
OrdinaryDiffEq solvers (`ImplicitEuler`, `Trapezoid`, `KenCarp4`, …) allocate
a dense `N×N` Jacobian buffer — fatal at AIBECS production scale (~80 GB
at `nb = 1e5`).

`tspan` may be given in seconds (`Real`) or with `Unitful` time units; in
both cases the underlying integration runs in seconds.

When `jac_constant_in_u = true`, the Jacobian is evaluated once at `(u0, p)`,
cached, and returned by a closure that ignores its `u` argument. This signals
to the integrator that the W matrix `I/dt - J` can be factorised once and
reused across all time steps. Use this **only** when you know `G(u,p)` is
affine in `u` (e.g. ideal age, radiocarbon, any linear tracer); for nonlinear
sources leave it `false` so the Jacobian is re-evaluated as the integrator
expects.
